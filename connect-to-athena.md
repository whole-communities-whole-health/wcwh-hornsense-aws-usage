# Connect to AWS Athena

AWS Athena is a SQL query editor that will allow you to retrieve data from the database.

## 1. Login with UT EID and password
Bookmark the link to the AWS portal login page: https://utexas.awsapps.com/start. Go to the 
portal page, and login with your EID and password.

## 2. AWS access portal page
The AWS access portal page has an orange icon. Some people have access to multiple options here.  

Select the label "VRES-WCWH-Cohort" and then the "COLAITSDataLakeAnalyst" link for the **WCWH** study.  
Select the label "KHED-feasible-main" and then the "FEASible-athena" link for the **FEASible** study.

## 3. AWS console page
Now you are signed into AWS and are on the main console landing page. You will see 
that many things are disabled for you. Use the search bar at the top left to search 
for "Athena."

Click the star icon to create a shortcut to the Athena query editor and then select
the Athena option to go to the Athena query editor.

## 5. Athena landing page
If AWS loads a page that looks like this, select the three horizontal lines at the
top left, and then the query editor link. If you don't see this screen, go to the
next step.

## 6. Athena console settings 
The Athena query editor is where you will have access to collected data.  

**WCWH Study**
Make sure your region is US East (Ohio), your workgroup is "primary" and that the 
database selection is "participant-data."  

**FEASible study**
Make sure your region is US East (Ohio), your workgroup is "primary" and that the 
database selection is "feas_prod_athena_db."  

These options should be auto selected for you in the future.

## 7. Query the data
You will now see the data tables you are able to query on the left side of the 
screen. There are a couple SQL queries to get you started on the "saved queries" 
tab on the navigation bar. The "download results" button will allow you to save 
the results of a query in CSV format.

## 8. Save queries you write
You can write your own queries and save them. Use the three vertical dots hidden 
menu next to the query number to save queries you want to use again.
